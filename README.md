# Group Chat Project
This C# Windows Forms project is a TCP/IP-based group chat application with two parts: a client app for user chat and a server app for administration. 
Clients connect to the server to send and receive messages in real-time, even supporting self-chat. 
The server tracks connected users, enables browsing, allows admins to kick users, and send broadcast messages. 
Additionally, it logs all messages for record-keeping. make description for server and client

# Client Application
The client application allows users to join the chat, send and receive real-time messages, and even chat with themselves. 
It connects to the server to enable seamless communication.
